#### Hey, I'm Brenda, and I occasionally create stuff ( Â´ â–½ ` )b
##### Previously, I worked as a product designer crafting B2B solutions. At the moment, I'm redesigning my site with Astro.
##### On my downtime, I'm super into JRPGs. I'm also veryyy normal about my favorite music, particularly keshi, thá»§y, and my [Persona playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-iFnr2GCXQmfRshHuzMcjoxjEnGramFe&si=XT9E2Hzs0ewHL41s).
